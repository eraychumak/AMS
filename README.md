# Academic Management System (AMS)

This system is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any frameworks. It soleley relies on the `json-server` JavaScript library to mock a REST API interface, which allows for the frontend to interact with the `db.json` file.

This fork is an extension implementation part of coursework two for the CIS2169 - Web Application Development module at Edge Hill University.

## Running the system (setup)
The project was setup using the yarn package manager.

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
2. Run `yarn run start` to run the server and use the system.
